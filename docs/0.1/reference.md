# Getting started

Before starting, make sure you have downloaded and installed latest version of NNX. You can get it on the [main page](/).  If you don't already have it, NNX addin will ask you to install [].NET framework 4.6 runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130). Needless to say, Excel is required.
